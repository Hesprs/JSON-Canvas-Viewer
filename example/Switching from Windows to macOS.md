Two years ago, I made the bold decision to switch from Windows to macOS after 15 years of using Microsoft's system. As a software developer, this decision was driven by my desire to experience a different and more integrated development environment, especially with the growing popularity of Apple Silicon devices. In this article, I will share my complete journey and what I’ve learned over these two years.

## Initial Transition

### First Challenges

When I first opened my MacBook Pro, it felt like learning a new language. Everything was different: button placement, shortcuts, even how to close windows. I had to learn that Command is the new Control and that closing windows is done from the left instead of the right.

### Preparing for the Switch

Before purchasing, I spent an entire month researching and choosing the right model. I settled on the MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16GB of memory. I compiled a list of alternative apps for every program I used on Windows and read numerous articles about setting up a development environment on macOS.

## Development Environment

### Development Tools

The first thing that amazed me was Homebrew. After years of manually installing software on Windows, it felt like magic. A single command in Terminal installed everything I needed. Visual Studio Code and Git worked better, and Docker ran seamlessly, especially with the M1 chip.

### Unix-Based System

The Unix-based system was a game-changer in my experience as a developer. Terminal commands became a natural part of my workflow, not just an add-on. The integration between development tools was far better than my experience with WSL on Windows.

## Performance and Technical Experience

### Performance

The M1 Pro chip redefined my understanding of laptop performance. Heavy projects that used to make my old computer groan now ran smoothly. Running Android and iOS emulators simultaneously became possible without any noticeable impact on performance.

### Device Quality

The Retina display is fantastic for long hours of work, and the Trackpad made me forget about using a mouse. The battery lasts a full day of intensive work, something I’d never experienced with any other laptop.

## Productivity and Daily Work

### Task Management

Mission Control and Spaces changed how I organize my work. I now have dedicated workspaces for coding, design, and communications. Spotlight saves me a lot of time when searching for files and apps.

### Integration with Other Devices

As an iPhone user, work became smoother. Copying text from my phone and pasting it directly on my computer, or replying to messages without touching my phone—these are features I can’t live without now.

## Obstacles and Challenges

### Missing Software

Some specialized software isn’t available on macOS, but I found good alternatives for most. The biggest challenge was with some older development tools designed for Windows.

### Cost

Yes, the price is high compared to similar Windows devices, but after two years, I can say the investment was worthwhile. The device’s quality and long lifespan justify the cost.

## macOS vs. Windows Comparison

### macOS Strengths

- Excellent integration between hardware and software
- Consistent and stable performance
- Integrated development environment
- Exceptional battery life

### Windows Strengths

- Greater flexibility in component choices
- Broader software compatibility
- More affordable options available
- Better gaming support

## Tips and Advice

### For New Developers on macOS

- Invest time in learning keyboard shortcuts
- Use Homebrew for software management
- Familiarize yourself with basic Terminal tools
- Try apps like Alfred or Raycast to boost productivity

### For Those Considering the Switch

Switching to macOS makes sense if:

- You develop iOS or macOS apps
- You want an integrated Unix development environment
- You value design and quality in the user experience
- You have the budget to invest in the system

## Conclusion

After two years, I don’t regret my decision to switch to macOS. Despite the high cost and initial challenges, I found that productivity and work comfort improved significantly. I recommend this change to developers looking for an integrated and stable work environment, especially with Apple Silicon chips.

Both systems are good, but macOS excels in providing a seamless and comfortable user experience for developers. If you’re considering the switch, take your time to research and prepare, and ensure this change suits your needs and work style.
